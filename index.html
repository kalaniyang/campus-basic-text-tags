        <h2>Basic HTML Text Tags</h2>

        <p>
            Comments are used to add additional information to pages that helps developers
            working on that code. You can also use a comment to hide content from your page.

        <h2>Marking up Text in Blocks</h2>

        <p>
            When you have text that is displayed in a block, usually with multiple lines,
            it's considered a paragraph. Paragraph text can include words or phrases that
            are emphasized in some way, and they can contain links and other markup used for
            text (but not headings). Paragraphs are block-level elements.
        </p>

        <p>
            It may happen that you have text, like a poem, that requires some special
            formatting. You'd need to ensure that each line displayed at a proper length,
            and you can do that with the line break tags.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember that you can use tags like <strong>strong</strong> and <em>em</em>
            to convey meaning in text.

        <h3>Excerpt from The Raven</h3>

        <p>
            <cite>A Poem by Edgar Allan Poe</cite><br>
            Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
            <br>
            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
            <br>
            “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
            Only this and nothing more.”

        <h2>Marking Up Text to Convey Meaning</h2>

        <p>
            Sometimes, you are marking up small pieces of text, including single letters
            and words, to convey some meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, if your page offered search results, it’s likely that you’d want
            to highlight the terms the user searched for.
        </p>

        <p>
            The primary <mark>focus area</mark> must be chosen from one of the four
            <mark>GIT focus areas</mark>. The secondary <mark>focus area</mark> can be
            any topic that will best aid the student's career path.
        </p>

        <p>
            We used the <b>b</b> and <i>i</i> tags above, but we haven’t talked about the
            <code>u</code> tag. These are not often used and can confuse the user.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inline examples of code tags include <code>p</code>, <code>section</code>,
            <code>header</code>, and <code>footer</code>.
